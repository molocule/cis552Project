# Total Score 98/100

## Proposal         5/5
## CP #1           10/10
## CP #2            9/10

## Correctness     25/25
+ The two randomized algorithms look correct

## Design          29/30
* Modularity
  + Good module breakdown

* Types
  + Made good use of our generator implementation from class

* FP
  + Nice use of functional design

* Functors, Monads, etc.
  + Liberal use of monads to thread the randomness through the algorithms

* Abstraction
  + `MonadGen` is a nice abstraction over random monads
  - There are a few rough edges on the API

## Testing         15/15
+ The project is half testing, so this speaks for itself
+ Unit tests are a good fall-back

## Style            5/5
+ Code looks well-factored and well-written
